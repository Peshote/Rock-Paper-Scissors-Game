# The "Rock - Paper - Scissors" Game

Rock Paper Scissors is deceptively simple. Players choose three separate ways of conquering their opponent in a highly technical duel of the minds. A player forms their hands into iconic tools of destruction in an attempt to best their opponents in the quest for glory. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock, and the cycle continues.

# The Project:
A console-based C# implementation of "Rock - Paper - Scissors" Game

The game is a simple **Two Player Game**, where you and your oponent (the computer) simultaneously choose one of the following three options: **"Rock"**, **"Paper"** or **"Scissors"**. The rules are as follows:

  * **Rock beats Scissors** (the Scissors get broken by the Rock)
  * **Scissors beats Paper** (the Paper get cut by the Scissors)
  * **Paper beats Rock** (the Paper covers the Rock)

The **Winner** is the player whose choice beats the choice of his oponent. If both players choose the same option (e.g. "Paper"), the game outcome is **"Draw"**.

# Input and Output
The **Player** enters one of the following options:
  * **rock** or **r**
  * **paper** or **p**
  * **scissors** or **s**

The **Computer** chooses a **random option**, then reveals the **Winner**.

After every **Round**: **Display** current statistics and **Prompt** player to play again.
